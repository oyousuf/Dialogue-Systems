> 1: lingqing was speeding down the highway at one billion and one kilometers per hour when she saw siyi, the heavyweight boxing champion of the world, running alongside her - both headed towards the fight between zhe and the giant. jenn, the lunar ally above, sent a message to flor to return home to help in the fight for the survival of the planet. flor ditched the dull philosophers, and as she turned back towards planet Earth, she was lit aflame by the sun transforming into the Phoneix Queen. Back below the ocean floor, Emma saw the falling of the giant, due to jenn's ocean waves, and sent her armada of underwater pirate ships to blast him back above the water. Daphne the dolphin cheered them on, but Oreen didn't as he was busy writing this story.
> 2: with the giant blown back up above the ocean's water, zhe punched him into the air with all his might. a sound was heard - thunder cracking - it was the sound of siyi throwing lingqing the racecar into the air towards the giant. lingqing made impact on the giant blowing him up into pieces just as the silent one - angeliki - revoked her vow of silence as the earth needed her help. she laughed. she laughed causing a sound wave so great it caused buildings to crumble, and mountains to quack. but it also tore apart the giant's remaining limbs. the giant - without limbs, and still floating in the air - felt warmer and warmer. with the last of his strength he looked up to see a ball of fire blazing towards him. "TJENA!!!!!" roared the Phoenix Queen Flor as she met the giant mid-air and disintegrated what was left of him. --- FIN ---
