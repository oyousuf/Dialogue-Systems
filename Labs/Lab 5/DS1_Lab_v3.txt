g	okay 	
g	starting off we are above a caravan park

f	mmhmm 	
*g	not straight east slightly sort of northeast 	
f	s-- slightly northeast 	
g	slightly slightly yeah 	
g	very slightly 	
g	and we're going to continue straight along erm quite a wee dis-- a wee distance erm quite a wee distance right we're going to continue along on that course 	
g	and then we're going to turn north again 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and immediat-- well a distance below that turning point there's a fenced meadow 	
*g	but you should be avoiding that by quite a distance 	
f	okay 	
g	okay so we've turned and we're going up north again 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	continue straight up north 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and then we're going to turn to the west on a curvature right sort of 	
f	okay 	
g	"s" bend and immediately below that bend there is an abandoned cottage 	
*f	mmhmm 	
f	okay 	
g	and we're passing above the top of that 	
g	we're going to continue in that sort of "s" shape a big wide "s" 	
f	mmhmm 	
*g	and on the sort of mmhmm top erm left of that again below it there's a fenced meadow 	
g	but you're passing on the top of that 	
g	okay 	
g	right okay 	
f	okay 	
g	we've gone from the abandoned cottage right and we're on the sort of "s" shape yeah

*f	mmhmm 	
g	okay 	
g	we're going straight due north 	
g	at the top there there's a west lake 	
*f	okay 	
g	which we're going to pass on the south erm southeast side 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and we're going to do that in a curve almost a half "u" shape 	
f	half "u" shape to the southeast 	
g	yeah 	
*g	yeah the southeast 	
f	right okay 	
g	and continue up north slightly 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	but not quite to the tip of that lake 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and then we're going to turn down ove-- above a trig point and we're going to turn immediately to your right and straight down at an angle of forty-five 	
f	right 	
g	okay 	
g	and we're going to continue that wee distance down and that the point at the end of that it should be near to the abandoned cottage where we went past miles away but if not just carry on and then continue down in that forty-five degree 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	and turn round by a monument on the outside of the monument 	
*f	outside of the monument 	
g	yeah 	
g	and then a very slight turning up again north sort of northwest 	
f	mmhmm 	
g	very slight curve sort of very slight "s"-shaped just a slight curve and then going to proceed up north again 	
g	on the right-hand side there's a nuclear test site before right before reaching the top of that northbound 	
g	and then you're going to turn back west 	
g	and above that there's an east lake 	
*f	oh right okay 	
g	yeah

B:	- the  . this - - - sort of - well for
A:	m
*B:	- the combination of subjects - this is not going to come to anything nobody really wants it they think it's ideal in one way but it's m - if it's going to fold up to 
A:	m there was a very nice letter in the Observer - on Sunday I don't know whether you . noticed
*B:	I didn't see that . no - - -
A:	m - - saying that m - - mentioning a number of ways in which . we were now going American - in a way - - in directions - - which . were being reversed in America or where America was trying to go British - in the
B:	m mhm
A:	- direction of the . British methods that we are trying to abandon - - m - and one of
B:	m
*A:	- them is this  - - - (starts reading) in the field of higher education - a similar debate in reverse goes on - in Cornell - - - m - - - young American professors are typically determined to toughen curricula - by increasing the emphasis on individual disciplines . just as their counterparts in this country - are with equal favour promoting broader cross-disciplinary programmes . often inspired by the North American precedent (stops reading) -
B:	yes - dh this this is very interesting actually because I'm quite sure ? m that that that that we're wrong . I I'm sure the
*A:	yes
B:	- Americans were right . over this -  this this Cornell  . business which
A:	yes
*B:	- was - after all we are specialists .  and we cannot tackle the broad fields
A:	m . that's right . yes
B:	- that say . Paul Knott's generation
A:	no
B:	- tackled - m . and the generation beyond
A:	m . no
B:	- that .  even even more so -
A:	quite
*B:	and  until we recognize that specialization has arrived -  we we're going to end up nowhere .
*A:	m m . m
B:	- and this is the trouble in schools you see I I I'm absolutely convinced that the schools are wrong - - in trying to tackle a sort of general course . after the age of sixteen by the age of sixteen anybody who is going to be an academic should have done their general reading - -  in this day and age
*A:	m
